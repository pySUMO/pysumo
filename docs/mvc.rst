Model
-----
| The model contains both the Parser and the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generated by the Parser.
| The AST stores the Ontology in memory and allows modifications thereof.
| The Parser provides both a kif-parser and serializer as well as a parser for the SUMO-WordNet mapping.

Controller
----------
The controller contains all base functionality of the program. It mediates all
accesses to the AST, creates and maintains an index and handles interactions
with WordNet. The controller also handles all other core functionality of
pySUMO such as undo and redo.

View
----
The view consists of all the graphical elements of pySUMO including, but not
limited to the Qt GUI.
